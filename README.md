# Welcome to GitHub Desktop!

Avis Chen

This repository exists to learn how to use GitHub Desktop. While the GitHub website is easy to use, the GitHub Desktop allows for changes to be made locally while disconnected from the internet. Both options are significantly more user friendly than using Git by itself, although a user native Linux may prefer the terminal environment of raw Git. For the purposes of this class and the ongoing final project, GitHub Desktop will be the perferred application moving forward.
